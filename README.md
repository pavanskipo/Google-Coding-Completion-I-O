# Google-Coding-Completion-Input-Output

Boilerplate code for reading inputs and printing outputs for Google Coding Competitions like Kickstart, Hashcode, etc

## What's this Repo for?

Google uses standard Input and Output for it's coding competitions,  I was very confused with this at the beginning and ended up spending a lot of time simply to get Input and Output working.
#### So I made this simple Boilerplate code with sample Input and Output which can be used to save time while coding ( ^ _ ^ ).
